# Image Analysis
## Assignments
### Assignment 1
In this assignment we study basic **histogram equalization**, **linear algebra for images** and start our work on our own **Optical Character Recognition** system. 

### Assignment 2
In this assignment we will study **convolution**, **filtering**, **interpolation**, **classification** and continue our work on our own **Optical Character Recognition** system. 

### Assignment 3
In this assignment we will work on line fitting problem using Least Squares methods, as well as on machine learning problems and continue working on our own Optical Character Recognition system from the previous assignments.

### Assignment 4
In this assignment we will study \textit{graph cuts for segmentation}, solve a computer vision problem, and make our final version of our own Optical Character Recognition system.
