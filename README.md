# Image Analysis
The goal of image analysis / computer vision is to bridge the gap between pixels and “meaning”. Related research areas can be:
* **Geometry**: 3D shape, camera calibration, camera motion , structure and motion, robotics.
* **Medical Image Analysis**: Shape variation, segmentation, tomography, decision support.
* **Cognitive Vision**: recognition, detection, scene interpretation, attention, segmentation, handwriting recognition.

## Assignments
* **Assignment 1**: In this assignment we study basic *histogram equalization*, *linear algebra for images* and start our work on our own *Optical Character Recognition* system. 

* **Assignment 2**: In this assignment we will study *convolution*, *filtering*, *interpolation*, *classification* and continue our work on our own *Optical Character Recognition* system. 

* **Assignment 3**: In this assignment we will work on line fitting problem using Least Squares methods, as well as on machine learning problems and continue working on our own Optical Character Recognition system from the previous assignments.

* **Assignment 4**: In this assignment we will study *graph cuts for segmentation*, solve a *computer vision* problem, and make our final version of our own Optical Character Recognition system.
